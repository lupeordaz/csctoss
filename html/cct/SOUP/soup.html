1.  Log in to SOUP server and 'sudo su -'
2.  log in to the mysql database:  mysql -u root sdm
3.  Using the sql from copy_cellsignal_to_csctoss.sh, execute the 
    following query:

    SELECT a.esn
          ,TRIM(SUBSTRING(a.esn, 1, LOCATE(',', a.esn) - 1)) AS esn1
          ,TRIM(SUBSTRING(a.esn, LOCATE(',', a.esn) + 1)) AS esn2
          ,a.cellsignal,
    FROM_UNIXTIME(a.timestamp) AS timestamp
    FROM cellsignal a
    WHERE 1 = 1
    AND a.timestamp >= unix_timestamp(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL 1 DAY)

    Result is 88 records displayed; way to small a population.

4.  Re-ran the script with 'INTERVAL 2 DAY'.

5.  Results showed a large number of entries, which is expected.  Something
    happenned within last two days.
6.  Checked /opt/sdm/sdm.log and found that there was a reboot two days ago.
7.  Check to see if the python script /opt/sdm/sdm.py is running.  Issuing a ps -ef
    command shows that the script is not running.
8.  Execute the /opt/sdm/startsdm script to start the sdm.py program

    ./startsdm

9.  Issue the ps -ef command again:

    ps -ef | grep sdm

    [root@densoup01 sdm]# ps -ef | grep sdm
    root       461     1  4 14:53 pts/1    00:00:00 python2 /opt/sdm/sdm.py -v
    root       505 32552  0 14:53 pts/1    00:00:00 grep sdm
    root      9040  9039  0 Mar14 ?        00:00:00 inotifywait -m /opt/sdm/savefiles -e create -e moved_to
    [

10. Execute the "tail -f /opt/sdm/sdm.log" command to verify that data is being generated.

11. On OSS, query database table soup_ellsignal:

    select count(*) FROM soup_cellsignal ;
     count 
    -------
      4566
    (1 row)

    This verifies that data is being transmitted.

12. Issue is resolved.
